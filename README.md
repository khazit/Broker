Broker was created as a tool for a team of 9 ML practitioners to manage their 
access to a single GPU machine. The idea was to avoid running multiple jobs at
once (which would cause OOM errors), and to have a dashboard to visualize the 
jobs and their respective states.

According to Wikipedia:
> A broker's prime responsibility is to bring sellers and buyers together and 
> thus a broker is the third-person facilitator between a buyer and a seller.

In the same way, the global architecture of the system was designed around the
Scheduler, the API that connects users with runners.

Theoretically, the system could scale to multiple runners. But has yet to be
tested.

## Install
### Scheduler
To install the Scheduler on the main host machine (API + Dashboard):

Open `docker/docker-compose-dev.yml` and modify the commented lines. Then,
using docker-compose, build the two images
```
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-dev.yml build
```

And run the app:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

You can either use the Web UI ...

... or the bash script `broker` for command line usage.

### Runners
Runners are single file python scripts, that you can run directly on your
python env or on a docker container using `docker/runner-dev.Dockerfile`.
The only dependancy is `requests`.

Using poetry:
```
$ cd runner
$ python runner.py --scheduler_ip [IP] --scheduler_port [PORT]
```

## Caveats
This is my first time writing an API / doing web dev. This is a development
version that has no security at all. 

## Aknowledgements
The dashboard uses this template
