"""
Runner that, once installed on a remote host, can receive jobs to execute
from the Scheduler

Manages 3 types of interactions  with the Scheduler:
    1. Sends a GET request when the Runner is available to receive a new job
    2. Receives via a POST request info about the job to execute
    3. Sends a POST request when the job is done to update the status

This runner is written using no objects from the Broker API backend (Job and
JobStatus are not used here for eg, even if they could be useful). This was
done on purpose to minimize the dependancy on the Scheduler, and make the
whole architecture as compartmentalized as possible.
